## tl;dr

You can set whether the page should return to where it was originally scrolled when the user presses the back button.

```javascript
const scrollRestoration = history.scrollRestoration;
if (scrollRestoration === "manual") {
  console.log(
    "If the option is set to manual, the scroll position will not be restored and the user will have to move it manually."
  );
}
```

## Scroll Restoration

This section is about **Scroll Restoration**, the browser History API for scroll restoration.
This API allows you to set whether the page should return to the original scroll position when the user presses the browser's back button.

The default is **auto**, and setting this to **manual** will not restore the scrolled position.

```javascript
// Restore the user's scroll position on the page.
history.scrollRestoration = "auto"; // default

// The position on the page is not restored and the user must manually scroll to that position.
history.scrollRestoration = "manual";
```
